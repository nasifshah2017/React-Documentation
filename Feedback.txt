For me, First of regarding React, I would choose which starting route would I prefer either 
Create React App/ Gatsby or Next JS. I chose Next JS as I no longer need to use React Router 
nor React Lazy Loading as both is built in Next JS and is also good for SEO. Regarding Hooks, 
I only use mostly useState and useEffect whereas for side Effects I’ll use Redux Saga instead 
of Redux thunk. For larger state management, I’ll use the standard Redux actions and reducers. 
For css I use CSS modules and Material Ui and React bootstrap. So my recommendation would be 
first choose your preferred approach in each category and go deeper with the path you chose 
instead of trying to learn them all in a short run cause there’s just too many things to learn 
if you go general and wide.
