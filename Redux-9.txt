Adding Meat and Produce

In this lesson we are going to go through setting up the Meat and Produce actions so that we have the full circle of all three of our 
Reducers, Components and Actions, and we are going to go through it from the beginning of each of them and hopefully that will be very good
review, if you already got it down then it is upto you if you want to stick around or if you just want to go to the GitHub repo and check it
out, but I think it will be a good review to just walkthrough this again and then just try and connect the pieces together.

So, we have just got our MeatDept which is our one of the three main components, then the meatReducer and then the meatAction 
(meatInvUpdate) and they are all open and we are importing the meatAction as updateMeat in our MeatDept.js file, and that is not good enough
and the reason behind that is when the meatAction (updateMeat()) function runs, we need to notify the meatReducer, so that the 
meatReducer can decide whether to update the state, so that the quantity of the meat items in the Store can change, because in the 
MeatDept.js file we are using that piece of state in the 'redux' store (this.props.meatData), so we need to make sure that our Action 
updates that.

Inside of our meatAction or action creator,


meatInvUpdate.js

export default () => {

	return {

		type: 'updateMeat'
	}
}


Here we need to add the payload, so we need to update our action, we need to update the logic in the meatReducer, so that it updates 
appropriately.


export default (state = seedData, action) => {

	console.log("Meat Reducer is running!");
	
	console.log(action);

	return state;

}


Then we need to make sure that we get them connected inside of the 'react' component itself. So, we will start from below at our 
MeatDept.js file,


function mapStateToProps(state) {

	return {

		meatData: state.meat,

	}
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MeatData);


Our connect() function right now is exporting mapStateToProps() and that is getting us the this.props.meatData, and we also need the 
mapDispatchToProps() function and this function will take the 'dispatch' as an argument because that is how we connect the action to 
dispatch, and the dispatch is how we get the Action over to the Reducer,


function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {

	return bindActionCreators({ 

		updateMeat: updateMeat

	}, dispatch)

}


If you remember mapDispatchToProps() returns "bindActionCreators()" and we are going to pass it an object and the time we type the word 
"bindActionCreators()" on VS-Code, VS-Code automatically imports it for us from the 'redux' module (import {bindActionCreators} from 
'redux'), if VS-Code does not import it automatically then include the line in the brackets as we need to manually go at the top of the 
file and type out this line. 

So, we are going to return 'bindActionCreators', and we are going to pass it "updateMeat" so that will be actually the 
"this.props.updateMeat", this is the property of the object that we are passing to the bindActionCreators and the value of this property 
is going to be the "updateMeat" (meatInvUpdate) action that we are importing at the top of the file, and the second argument that we need 
to send to the bindActionCreators() is the actual 'dispatch'. So, now we can call "this.props.updateMeat" which is the same as calling the
"updateMeat()" function, which is coming from the meatInvUpdate.js file, which is this function,


meatInvUpdate.js

export default () => {

	return {

		type: "updateMeat"
	}
}


The only difference is that this function is going to be sent to every Reducers, because it is going to be connected to the 'dispatch'.

Before we do that we need to go back there and we have the "this.increment" like we had in our other file and we do not need the operators 
in the increment() function anymore instead we just need to pass the "this.props.updateMeat" and thats all we need to do,


 increment = (operation, index) => {

	this.props.updateMeat(operation, index);

}


That is all we need to do. This will automatically call the updateMeat() (meatInvUpdate) but as we added this function to 
mapDispatchToProps() function,


function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {

	return bindActionCreators({

		updateMeat: updateMeat

	}, dispatch)


This is why it is going to be sent to every Reducer. So, over inside the meat Action function (or the Action creator) we are now going to 
pass the "operation" and the "index",


meatInvUpdate.js

export default (operation, index) => {

	return {

		type: 'updateMeat'
	}
}


And instead of only returning 'updateMeat' we are going to add a payload and the payload is going to be an object and the object is going 
to have both the operation and the index,


meatInvUpdate.js

export default (operation, index) => {

	return {

		type: 'updateMeat',

		payload: {

			operation,

			index

		}
	}
}


So, the Action Creator returns an Action and the Action is just a pass through with the data inside the payload and a type. So, over 
inside the meatReducer now, we need to add an if-else condition. Remember, every single time the meatReducer gets notified it is always 
going to be an action and every action must have a type, so now if we make action.type === 'updateMeat' then this is the department where 
we need to increment / decrement the items. Instead of only returning the state we are going to make a new variable. We will call it as 
"newState" and we will assign it to the current state, with the spread (...) operator to add the current state in to the newState, 


export default (state = seedData, action) => {

	console.log("Meat Reducer is running!");

	console.log(action);

	if(action.type === 'updateMeat') {

		const newState = [...state];

	}

	return state;
}


So, we have the current state (state) coming up as an arguement, assigned to the seedData array, that is automatically part of the reducer.
It knows what its current state is, so we are taking that state and we are making a copy of it, we are not mutating with the old piece of 
state. This time to make our lives a little bit easier we will also add the payload and we will assign it to "action.payload". 

We will also check to see the payload which is our object if "payload.operation === +" then that means we need to increment the quantity 
of the payload by one (newState[payload.index].quantity++), then we will also use an if-else statement and we will do the exact same thing
just as we did before but this time we will change the operator to "-", "payload.operation === -",


meatInvUpdate.js

export default (state == seedData, action) => {

	console.log("Meat Reducer is running!");

	console.log(action);

	if(action.type === "updateMeat") {

		const newState = [...state];

		const payload = action.payload;

		if(payload.operation === "+") {

			newState[payload.index].quantity++;

		} else if {

			newState[payload.index].quantity--;

		}
	}

	return state;
}


In another way we can do this instead of doing "+" and "-", if we go back over to the Meat department (MeatDept.js) component instead of 
passing "+" and "-" we can pass 1 and -1 and we also need to change the operation that we pass in the increment function to "qChange" 
which is short for "quantity change", might not be the best variable name but that is what we will pass through, 


MeatDept.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';
import updateMeat from "../actions/meatInvUpdate";


class MeatDept extends Component {

	increment = (qChange, index) => {

		this.props.updateMeat(operation, index);

	}


	render() {

			const meatInventory = this.props.meatData((item, i) => {

				return(

						<div key = {i}>

							<li>{item.food}: {item.quantity}</li>
							
							<input type = "button" onClick = {() => {this.increment(1, i)}} value = "+" />

							<input type = "button" onClick = {() => {this.increment(-1, i)}} value = "-" />

						</div>

				)

			})


			return (

					<div>

						<h1>The Meat Department</h1>

						<ul>

							{meatInventory}

						</ul>

					</div>

			)

	)

}


function mapStateToProps(state) {

	return {

			meatData: state.meat

	}

}


function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {

	return bindActionCreators{( 

		updateMeat: updateMeat

	}, dispatch)

}


export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MeatDept)


qChange might not be the best variable name but that is what we will pass through. Now, we will go back to meatInvUpdate and change 
operation to qChange too, 


meatInvUpdate.js


export default (qChange, index) => {

	return {

			type: 'updateMeat',

			payload: {

					qChange,

					index

			}
	}
}


Now, in the meatReducer we can reduce our code, we do not need to check what the operation is as we already know that,


				if(payload.operation === '+') {


It will get incremented by 1 or it will get decremented by -1,


				else(payload.operation === '-') {


so we can get rid of this logic here and we will assign the "newState[payload.index].quantity" directly to "payload.qChange",


export default (state = seedData, action) => {

		console.log("Meat Reducer is running!"); 

		console.log(action);

		if(action.type === 'updateMeat') {

			const newState = [...state];

			const payload = action.payload;

			newState[payload.index].quantity += payload.qChange;

		}

		return state;

}


So, the payload is coming from the action.payload over in the meat action (meatInvUpdate.js) has a qChange,


meatInvUpdate.js


export default(qChange, index) => {

	return {

		type: 'updateMeat',
		
		payload: {

				qChange,

				index

		}

	}

}


And qChange will be whatever the first thing is at the MeatDept.js which is going to be either 1 or -1,


			increment = (qChange, index) => {

					this.props.updateMeat(qChange, index);

			}


Which means all the way back to the meatReducer we are going to "+=" either -1 or 1, we do not really care which but the 
"newState[payload.index].quantity" will be updated currently and now we can simply return newState and it saves ourselves a few lines, and
if it is not the meatReducer action type then we return the old state,


export default (state = seedData, action) => {

	console.log("Meat Reducer is running!");

	console.log(action);

	if(action.type === 'updateMeat') {

		const newState = [...state];

		const payload = action.payload;

		newState[payload.index].quantity += payload.qChange;

		return newState;		// Returning the updated state

	} else {

		return state;		// Else if this meat action was not selected then we are returning the old state



So, the "if statement" runs only if the action that we are getting is 'updateMeat' otherwise just return the state as it was. So, that 
covers the meatReducer. We will go back to the browser and give it a try,


localhost: 3000


					     The Frozen Food Department

 			    				 TV dinners: 10
				
			                 		   |+| |-|

			    			     Frozen Veggies: 21
				
							   |+| |-|

			   			     Frozen Pizzas: 25

							   |+| |-|


					     
						   The Meat Food Department

 			    				 Chicken Brest: 10
				
			                            |+| |-|

			    			         Bacon: 21
				
							    |+| |-|

			   			        Mahi Mahi: 25

							    |+| |-|

							  Salmon: 135

							    |+| |-|	


						The Produce Food Department

 			    				 TV dinners: 10
				
			                 		    |+| |-|

			    			        Turnips: 21
				
							    |+| |-|

			   			         Apples: 25

							    |+| |-|

							 Cilantro: 135

							    |+| |-|


And now it is incrementing and decrementing the items the way it should. The produce department does not work yet, but we just need to 
update it the same way as the meat department, and set up the dispatch there, 


produceInvUpdate.js

export default (qChange, index) => {

	return {

			type: 'updateProduce'

			payload: {

					qChange,

					index

			}
	
	}

}


produceReducer.js


// This is the Produce Reducer. The backend Produce Department.

// Creating demo data


const seedData = [

	{

		food: "Lettuce",

		quantity: 15

	},
	{
		
		food: "Spinach",

		quantity: 22

	},
	{

		food: "Cucumbers",

		quantity: 35

	}

];


export default (state = seedData, action) => {

		if(action.type === 'updateProduce') {

				const payload = action.payload;

				let newState = [...state];

				newState[payload.index].quantity = newState[payload.index].quantity + payload.qChange;

				return newState;

		}

		else {

				return state;

		}
}


ProduceDept.js


import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import updateProduce from "../actions/produceInvUpdate";

import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';


class ProduceDept extends Component {

		increment = (qChange, index) => {

			this.props.updateProduce(qChange, index);

		}


		render() {

				const produceInventory = this.props.produceData.map((item, i) => {

						return(

							<div key = {i}>

								<li>{item.food}: {item.quantity}</li>

								<input type = "button" onClick = {() => {this.increment(1, i)}} value = "+" />

								<input type = "button" onClick = {() => {this.increment(-1, i)}} value = "-" />

							</div>

						)


				})

				return(

						<div>
						
							<h1>The Produce Department</h1>

							<ul>

								{produceInvetory}

							</ul>

						</div>

				)

		}

{


function mapStateToProps(state) {

		return {

			produceData: state.produce
		}

}


function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {

		return bindActionCreators({

			updateProduce: updateProduce

		}, dispatch)

}


export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(ProduceDept);
