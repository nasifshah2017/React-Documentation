We have touched on all of the main lifecycle methods, there are few other ones and we will touch on those later on,
on the course and some of the projects and things, but we would like to do a project and get a little bit hands on,
so we can do something a little bit more creative and we will see how the pieces will actually move in an app that
we will actually build. But before we do that, we have a few more topics to cover, so we have some lessons to look
at, at the end of this section. We are going to talk briefly about forms and React handles forms a little bit 
differently than we might be used to, so we are going to look at forms (www.reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) and we 
going to also look at Lifting State Up (www.reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) and it is very common where we
will have two different componentsthat need to know about the same piece of State that is changing and React has a 
means of handling that and then we are going to talk about how to style components and then we will go in here in 
few lessons and knock out a kind of a fun project, where we would be able to pull all these together before we go
onto React Router, it will get us some good practice with the Component Lifecycle and some of the other ideas, so 
in the next lesson we will look at how React handles forms.
