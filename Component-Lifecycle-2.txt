We started a new section in the last lesson so the first thing we need to do is get a new directory or a folder to
work in. So, we need to run "cd.." to return to our main folder,

Console coding:

section2 git:(master)x cd..
video-code git: (master)x ls
-> assets project1 project2 section1 section2 starterFiles
video-code git:(master)x create-react-app section3
video-code git:(master)x cd section3

We have created our "section3" folder and we got inside it, now we will run the basic React app that we downloaded
from the Node Package Manager (npm),

Console coding:

section3 git:(master)x npm start

This will automatically open up our browser and display the rotating React logo on our UI. Now, we will open our
App.js file and delete all the code that we have under '<div className="App">' and we will code our way,


App.js

import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App(){
	return(
		<div className="App">
			<h1>Sanity Check</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
export default App;

localhost: 3000

		Sanity Check


Until now everything that we have done is from hard-coded data, we were given some JSON, it was an array, that we
included with script tag or we did the import. That is not the way the web works anymore as typically React will
be asking data from somewhere else because React is an UI framework, it does not have access to any databases or 
anything like that.

In order to make an HTTP request we need an HTTP client, because unlike Angular or some other framework there are
no built-in HTTP client with React. So, we can use the Fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
which  is built into native JavaScript now, there is also jQuery (www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) where we can use the
dollar sign ($) to make AJAX Requests the same way that we have always made them, but in our lessons we are going 
to use Axios and the reason for that is because of these three options alone with a handful of others, it is by far
the most common.

We will install the axios package from npm through our console,

Console coding:

section3 git:(master)x npm install axios

				INSTALLATION

Now we will include the axios in our App.js file by importing it,


App.js

import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import axios from 'axios';

function App(){
	return(
		<div className="App">
			<h1>Sanity Check</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
export default App;


The 'axios' represents the axios package that we downloaded and we are going to import the default export that 
axios sends as "axios", and we are going to use axios to make our HTTP request, but before we do that we are 
going to end this lesson here and in the next lesson we have an URL that we need to copy and we will use that URL
in the next lesson after that.
