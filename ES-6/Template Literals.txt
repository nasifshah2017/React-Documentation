// We are going to take a look at Template Literals.
// These are pretty straight forward and extremely useful
// and they are quite simple 

const firstName = "Rob";
const lastName = "Bunch";
const fullName = firstName + lastName;

console.log(fullName);		// RobBunch

// We realize that we forgot to put a space in-between
// the first and last names. To sort this problem we
// normally need to concatenate a space in-between
// them

const firstName = "Rob";
const lastName = "Bunch";
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName);		// Rob Bunch

// Template Literals give us the ability to use the backticks ` `
// And we can insert variables in them as many as we want, by 
// using the $ and the {}, and it will display our variables 
// without the need of concatinating space in-between them, we
// can put a space just by pressing the space-bar. 

const firstName = "Rob";
const lastName = "Bunch";

const fullName = `${firsName} ${lastName}`

console.log(fullName);		// Rob Bunch

// We can also use the backticks to evaluate expressions 
// we can just insert JavaScript expressions inside ${}
// and that will get evaluated with out any hassle. We 
// will evalute the current year using JavaScript expressions.

const firstName = "Rob";
const lastName = "Bunch";

console.log(`The year is ${new Date().getFullYear()}, and I'm
excited!);

// Output: The year is 2020, and I'm excited!

// This is how the Template Literals work, the main thing to
// remember is that the backticks give us this power, and when 
// we are inserting a variable or an expression we need to store
// them inside ${}.
