// Here we will look into Object Literal notations
// and it would make things a lot simpler. Let's
// say we have this variables and we want to put
// them inside an object.

const a = 1;
const b = 1;
const c = 1;

// Now we want to store these variables inside an
// object.

const x = {
	a: a,		// Here we are declaring the property names as their values
	b: b,
	c: c
}

const name = "John Smith";
const job = "Designer";
const age = 35;

const data = {
	name: name,
	job: job,
	age: age
}

// This way of stroing variables inside an object is very
// boring as you need to keep repeating your variable names
// as the property names. 

// In ES-6 they solve that problem by giving us the ability 
// to calling the names just once and the variables will get
// stored in the object as properties.

const name = "John Smith";
const job = "Designer";
const age = 35;

const data = {
	name,
	job,
	age,
}

console.log(data.name);		// John Smith


const name = "John Smith";
const job = "Designer";
const age = 35;

const prop = 'aPropertyName';

const data = {
	name,
	job,
	age,
	[prop]: 'Hello'
}

console.log(data);		

// Output: {name: John Smith, job: Designer, age: 35, aPropertyName: Hello}
